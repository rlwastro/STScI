    "Search Radius selection - The selection of the search size can be tricky, and depends on the science you are trying to accomplish. For this case, we want a radius large enough to find all the galaxies that have HST data, but small enough to not give you HSC objects that are not part of the galaxy. One approach is to start with a large search radius (say 20\") and then try smaller ones until you start loosing cases you would like to keep.
