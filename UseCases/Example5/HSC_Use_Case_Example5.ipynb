    "As we did in Step 3, make the plot by clicking the ![plot][1] icon. Note that we do not need to construct the U-I color as we did in Step 2 as we did that when we creating the catalog. Under Configuration, select X = U-I and Y = W3_F275W. Click on the Update Series button to plot the CMD. Reverse the Y axis to have magnitudes go from bright to faint. Note that there are many more objects in the plot than we had using the Discovery Portal query.\n",

    "The white dwarfs are blueward of the main band of stars. Of the 8 objects in the WD area, 6 are in Richer, 1 is not in the WFPC2 FOV (<span style=\"color:green;\">green</span>) used by Richer and hence is a new white dwarf candidate, and 1 is not visible on the WFPC2 F814W image (but is in the WFC3 data so is in the HSC; <span style=\"color:orange;\">orange</span>).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is always a good idea to go back to the HLA and look at each object to make certain it is not an artifact or have other issues. Below is a blowup of the one candidate (<span style=\"color:blue;\">blue</span>) that was not visible on the original WFPC2 F814W image.\n",
